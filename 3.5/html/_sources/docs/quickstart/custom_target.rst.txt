****************************
Custom Board to Do
****************************

This is stuff that I pulled out of the MPSoC quickstart that is specific to custom boards.  We need to clean this up and make this a separate section as it doesn't fit with the MPSoC board.


4. (Optional) How to leverage Vitis AI with PetaLinux 2022.2

   You can install the Vitis AI libraries on the target either at build-time or at run-time:

   		- Build-Time: Rebuild the system by configuring PetaLinux. For ``VAI3.0 Recipes``, refer to `Vitis-AI-Recipes <../petalinux-recipes.html>`__
   		- Run-Time: Install Vitis AI online via `dnf`. Execute ``dnf install packagegroup-petalinux-vitisai`` to complete the installation on the target. For more details, refer `VAI3.0 Online Install <../petalinux-recipes.html>`__
   
5. (Optional) How to update Vitis AI Runtime on the target

   If you have an updated version of the Vitis AI Runtime and wish to install the update to your target, follow these steps.

   -  Copy the board_setup/mpsoc folder to the board using scp:

      .. code-block:: Bash

         scp -r board_setup/mpsoc root@IP_OF_BOARD:~/

   -  Log in to the board using ssh. You can also use the serial port to login.
   -  Now, install the Vitis AI Runtime. Execute the following commands:

      ::
		
		cd ~/mpsoc
		bash target_vart_setup.sh
	




2. (Optional) Run ``zynqmp_dpu_optimize.sh`` to optimize board settings.

   The script runs automatically after the board boots up with the official image. But you can also find the ``dpu_sw_optimize.tar.gz`` in `DPUCZDX8G.tar.gz <https://www.xilinx.com/bin/public/openDownload?filename=DPUCZDX8G.tar.gz>`__.

   .. code-block:: Bash

       cd ~/dpu_sw_optimize/zynqmp/
       ./zynqmp_dpu_optimize.sh
