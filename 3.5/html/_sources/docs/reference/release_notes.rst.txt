Release Notes 3.5
=================

Version Compatibility
---------------------

Vitis |trade| AI v3.5 and the DPU IP released with the v3.5 branch of this repository are verified as compatible with Vitis, Vivado |trade|, and PetaLinux version 2023.1. If you are using a previous release of Vitis AI, you should review the :ref:`version compatibility matrix <version-compatibility>` for that release.


Documentation and Github Repository
-----------------------------------
- Merged UG1313 into UG1414
- Streamlined UG1414 to remove redundant content
- Streamlined UG1414 to focus exclusively on core tool usage.  Core tools such as the Optimizer, Quantizer and Compiler are now being utilized across multiple targets (ie Ryzen |trade| AI, EPYC |trade|) and this change seeks to make UG1414 more portable to these targets
- Migrated Adaptable SoC and Alveo specific content from UG1414 to Github.IO
- New Github.IO Toctree structure
- Integrated VART Runtime APIs in Doxygen format

Docker Containers and GPU Support
----------------------------------
- Removed Anaconda dependency from TensorFlow 2 and PyTorch containers in order to address Anaconda commercial license requirements
- Updated Docker container to disable Ubuntu 18.04 support (which was available in Vitis AI but not officially supported).  This was done to address `CVE-2021-3493 <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3493>`__.
