## Model Zoo

The Vitis AI Model Zoo is a diverse set of pre-trained models that can be used for reference for development of your own model, or which can potentially be deployed directly in your application.  You can learn more about the Vitis AI Model Zoo [here](https://gitenterprise.xilinx.com/quentonh/vitis-ai-staging/tree/master/model_zoo).

To make the job of understanding the Model Zoo a little easier, we have provided a downloadable spreadsheet that incorporates key data about the Model Zoo models.  You can obtain that spreadsheet [here](/reference/ModelZoo_VAI2.5_Github.xlsx)
