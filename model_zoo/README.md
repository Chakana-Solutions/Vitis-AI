# Vitis AI Model Zoo
This repository provides access to optimized deep learning models that can be used to speed up the deployment of deep learning inference on Xilinx&trade; targets. These models cover different applications, including but not limited to ADAS/AD, medical, video surveillance, robotics, data center, etc. You can get started with these free pre-trained models to better understand the benefits of Xilinx accelerated inference.
