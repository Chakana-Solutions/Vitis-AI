Installing VAI3.0 Online
========================

To install Vitis |trade| AI 3.0 at run time, you can execute the command ``dnf install vitis-ai-library`` command directly on the target.

.. note::

   Before the release of ``PetaLinux VAI3.0 update``, the previous version of Vitis AI will be installed. Usually, ``PetaLinux VAI3.0 update`` will be released approximately 1 month after the Vitis 3.0 release.
   
   If you use this method, please ensure that the target board is connected to the Internet.
